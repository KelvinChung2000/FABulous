        # You can slice ports using the normal python slicing syntax.
        # For example: self.a[3:0] //= self.b[7:4]
        # We follow the Verilog slicing convention, where the left side 
        # of the slicing operator is the MSB and the right side is the LSB
        # if you want to use string to access the ports, you can use the following syntax:
        # self["portName"] //= self["portName"]
        # Since this is running a python script, you can use any python code here
        # All the input to a mux will be in the order which the connections are made
        # For example, if you connect self.out //= self.a and then self.out //= self.b
        # The inputs to the mux will be [self.a, self.b]
