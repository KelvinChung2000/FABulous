# Covert your design into GDSII format

Once you have compiled your design into Verilog using the [building fabric](./building_fabric.rst) guide, you can then convert your design into a GDS file for fabrication. The harden process is a 2 stage process. We will first harden all the tiles, and then stitching them together. We chose to do this instead of compile the whole fabric as a flat net list is because in an FPGA there are a lot of repeated components, which means synthesis will be repeatably synthesis similar logic, and the subsequent place and route will also be doing the same. To speed up the hardening process, we deploy this two stage strategy with two key benefits:

1. Make fabric development time much faster.
2. Make scaling your fabric to larger design much easier.

Per tile hardening is much faster as the size of the design is just much smaller. And since a fabric have a lot of repeated elements, optimizing one majority tile might potentially give you huge benefits it terms of, power, performance and area (PPA), which enables you to have a performant fabric in a shorter time window. Another benefit is this allows multiple tile development happening simultaneously, which allow different parties with different specialty to fully optimize a part of the design.

Because we are reusing the existing each of the pre harden tile, this allows you to avoid re-harden all the tiles once again. To get a larger fabric you can simply "add more tiles" to the `fabric.csv` and you can have a much larger design. If you need to add new tiles for new functionality, you can only need to harden the newly created tile, without needing redoing the rest of the tile, which in turn, speed up your development process.

To take advantage of fabric stitching, there are two limitations to the tile physical implementation. First is the interface of the adjacent tile need to line up in the exact order, and they need to align physically with the same spacing. Second is the size of the tile of the adjacent tile in the same row must have the same height and tile in the same width must be the same width in order to have perfect stitching. For the tile interface alignment, this is something that our framework will handle, however the tile sizing is something that need special handle. In the following will describe all the details of each stage.

## Prerequisite

### Install tools

We use [librelane](https://github.com/librelane/librelane) as our main flow. To access the full flow, you will need to use the [Nix based installation method](). Which will provide you the full environment with all the required tools.

:::{note}
As of writing, we are using custom build of librelane, as a result, the upstream version of the librelane will not work. We are aiming to upstream all the changes.
:::

### Install PDK

To compile the design we will also need to install the PDK. In the Nix installation method we have also packaged in a PDK version manger [ciel](https://github.com/fossi-foundation/ciel). By default, we have set up the project to target the `ihp-sg13g2` process (130nm). To install the PDK run the following command:

```bash
ciel enable --pdk-family ihp-sg13g2 cb7daaa8901016cf7c5d272dfa322c41f024931f
```

## Changing PDK

We support all PDK that is supported by librelane. As a result you can switch to targeting other process node such as the Sky130A and gf180mcu. To switch to those PDK, you will need to modify the `FAB_PDK_ROOT` and `FAB_PDK`, in `./<project>/.FABulous/.env` or set them in the shell as an environment variable . For `FAB_PDK` will be the PDK you are using, and the `FAB_PDK_ROOT` will be where the PDK is located. If you are installing the PDK from `ciel`, it will be located at `.ciel` under the user directory. An example of the `.ven` will be:

```bash
#... existing content
FAB_PDK='sky130A'
FAB_PDK_ROOT='/home/<user>/.ciel/sky130A'
```

For any other PDK, you will need to bring up the PDK to be supported by liberlane. You can follow this [guide](https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contrib/PlatformBringUp.html) and this [guide](https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contrib/PlatformBringUp.html) for more details. For more advance node there it is likely that you will need to further modify and add steps to the flow for getting a working and manufactureable design.

## Tile to GDS

The covert a tile to into a GDSII file, run the following command:

```bash
fabulous> gen_tile_macro <tile name>
```

This will generate the tile GDS for you under the tile macro folder.

### Tile Config

You can change and customise any setting you want via modifying the `gds_config.yaml` file. There are two layers of configuration. There is a `gds_config.yaml` located at the `<project>/Tile/include` and in each of the tile, they have it respective `gds_config.yaml`. The one in the `include` is the base configuration which applies to all the tile, you can put all the settings that is common to all the tile in that file. For per tile specific configuration, you can set them using the `gds_config.yaml` at the tile.

The per tile `gds_config.yaml` is particularly useful and important as you can set per tile `die_area`. In order for the tile to perfectly stitch together, as mention before all tile in the same row much have the same height, and tile in the same column must have the same width, and you can control the tile sizing by using it. For what variable can be configured please check the [flow variable table](./gds_variable.md)

### Pin Config

During the generation process there will be an extra file generated under the `macro` folder, which is the `io_pin_order.yaml`. This file controls the placement of the IO pin along the tile. This is auto populated to make sure all the pin of a tile align with the adjacent tile. But one can modify it for whatever means, such as optimization. The following is an example of the IO config file:

```yaml
X0Y0:
    EAST:
    - max_distance: null
      min_distance: null
      pins:
      - E1BEG\[\d+\]
      - 5
      reverse_result: false
      sort_mode: bus_major
      ...
    WEST:
    - max_distance: null
      min_distance: null
      pins:
      - Co
      reverse_result: false
      sort_mode: bus_major
    ...
X0Y1:
    ...
```

The entry key `X0Y0` represent the location of the pin of a tile. For normal tile, it will just have `X0Y0`, this is mainly useful for supertile and to set where the pin should locate relative to the tile shape, having this control allow us to also align supertile and normal tile pin automatically. Then the second layer of key is setting along which side of the tile should have the allocated pin. Each entry within a `side` is controlling a pin placement group. The `pins` is a list of entry of the pin that you want to set. The entry of the pin can be either a regular expression that matches actual pins or an integer which indicate a virtual pin. A virtual pin is basically a placeholder to space out the pins. The value of the integer represent the number of virtual pin to be added. In the group you can set the `min_distance` and `max_distance` and the placement script will try it best to fulfil the requirement, and yield an error in the event of the constraint cannot be achieved. The order of the pin layout will be in the following format:


You can change the order of the list by setting the `reverse_result` to reverse the order of the list and sort_mode to change how the pin is being sorted. We support to sort mode, which is `bus_major` and `bit_minor`. `bus_major` will be sorting by the name of the name of the bus, and `bit_minor` will sort by the bit index of the bus. The following is an example:

```None
# Given these pins: [
    "data_bus[1]", "addr_bus[0]", "data_bus[0]", "addr_bus[1]"
]

# Bus Major
data_bus[0]  # Same bus, lower index
data_bus[1]  # Same bus, higher index
addr_bus[0]  # Different bus, lower index
addr_bus[1]  # Different bus, higher index

# Bit Minor
addr_bus[0]  # Index 0 first
data_bus[0]  # Index 0 second (different bus)
addr_bus[1]  # Index 1 first
data_bus[1]  # Index 1 second (different bus)
```

## Stitching the tiles

Once all the tile is compiled to GDS format with correct sizing, we then can stitch them together, and we can do this by using the following command:

```bash
fabulous>gen_fabric_macro
```

And the full fabric will be stitched together.

```image>```

We have a custom top level IO placement script which will align all the pins with the IO pins around the parameter. You will notice there is a small halo ring around the fabric as we will need some extra space to get the clock leader routed. Same as tile implementation, there is a `gds_config.yaml` file under the `Fabric` folder there are some extra variables that you can set, and you can check what can be from the [flow variable table](./gds_variable.md)
