# Simulation setup

FABulous provides a simulation environment to validate that the generated
FPGA fabric works correctly. The simulation loads a test bitstream, built from
the user design, into the simulated FABulous fabric RTL and verifies that
configuration, routing, and primitive behavior function as intended.

:::{important}
The purpose of FABulous simulation is to verify the **generated fabric
implementation**, not to validate user designs mapped onto it. If you need to
test your own design logic, use a standard HDL testbench for your design
before mapping it to the fabric.

The following diagram illustrates the simulation flow and how the different
components interact.

    F[FABulous] --> G[Fabric RTL]

    E --> H[Testbench Simulation]
    G --> H
    H --> I{Pass / Fail}
```

For simple use cases, there is the `run_simulation` command in the FABulous shell.
For more complex use cases it can be useful to create your own flow using the
`Taskfile.yml` provided in each project's `Test/` directory.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure to use recent versions of [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys), [nextpnr-generic](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr) (_not_ the old FABulous nextpnr fork),
and either [NVC](https://github.com/nickg/nvc) or [GHDL with mcode backend](<https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl/releases>), or use the [OSS-CAD-Suite](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build) which provides nightly builds of the necessary dependencies.

:::{note}
**NVC is significantly faster than GHDL for our simulation.** We recommend installing NVC first. The simulation will automatically use NVC if available, otherwise it falls back to GHDL.

If using GHDL, we recommend the mcode backend for better simulation performance. The OSS-CAD-Suite provides only LLVM backend, which is slower than mcode.

## Taskfile

FABulous uses [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev) (a modern, YAML-based task runner)
to manage the simulation build flow. Each project is created with a `Taskfile.yml`
in the `Test/` directory that defines all the steps needed to synthesize, place
and route, generate bitstreams, and run simulations.

The `task` command is installed automatically as part of the FABulous package.

### Running a simulation

From the project's `Test/` directory, run the full pipeline (build + simulate + clean)
with a single command.

```console
cd demo/Test
task
```

To run individual steps, use the task name directly.

```console
task build-test-design    # synthesize, place & route, generate bitstream
task run-simulation       # run the simulation only
task clean                # remove the build directory
```

To see all available tasks, run `task --list`.

### Customizing variables

All key parameters are defined as variables at the top of `Taskfile.yml` and can
be overridden via the command line without editing the file.

```console
task run-simulation DESIGN=my_design WAVEFORM_TYPE=vcd
```

The available variables are:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DESIGN` | `sequential_16bit_en` | Name of the user design (without extension) |
| `TOP_WRAPPER` | `top_wrapper` | Top-level wrapper module name |
| `WAVEFORM_TYPE` | `fst` | Waveform output format (`fst` or `vcd`) |
| `BUILD_DIR` | `build` | Build output directory |
| `FAB_PROJ_ROOT` | `..` | Path to the project root |
| `SIMULATOR` | `iverilog` (Verilog), `auto` (VHDL) | Simulator backend. Verilog: `iverilog` or `xvlog`. VHDL: `nvc`, `ghdl`, `xvhdl`, or `auto`, where `auto` uses NVC if available and GHDL otherwise |
| `BITSTREAM_BIN` | `build/<DESIGN>.bin` | Path to the `.bin` bitstream file |
| `EXTRA_IVERILOG_FLAGS` | *(empty)* | Extra flags passed to iverilog (Verilog only) |
| `EXTRA_NVC_FLAGS` | *(empty)* | Extra flags passed to NVC (VHDL only) |
| `EXTRA_GHDL_FLAGS` | *(empty)* | Extra flags passed to GHDL (VHDL only) |
| `EXTRA_XVLOG_FLAGS` | *(empty)* | Extra flags passed to xvlog (Verilog, xsim only) |
| `EXTRA_XVHDL_FLAGS` | *(empty)* | Extra flags passed to xvhdl (VHDL, xsim only) |
| `EXTRA_XELAB_FLAGS` | *(empty)* | Extra flags passed to xelab (xsim only) |
| `XSIM_SNAPSHOT` | `<DESIGN>_xsim` | xelab snapshot name; also names the xsim log and waveform (xsim only) |
| `MAX_BITBYTES` | `16384` | Maximum bitstream size in bytes |

Variables can also be set via environment variables or the project's
`.FABulous/.env` file (loaded automatically via `dotenv`).

### Using the CLI

The `run_simulation` CLI command is a thin wrapper that invokes the Taskfile.
It takes the path to a `.bin` bitstream file generated by `compile_design`,
converts it to the `.hex` format expected by the testbench, and then runs the
simulation via the Taskfile. The design name is inferred from the bitstream
filename unless overridden with `-d`.

```console
# Basic usage (converts design.bin to hex and simulates)
FABulous> run_simulation fst path/to/design.bin

# Specify a different design name
FABulous> run_simulation fst path/to/design.bin -d my_design

# Pass extra simulator flags
FABulous> run_simulation fst path/to/design.bin --extra-iverilog-flag="-DDEBUG"
FABulous> run_simulation fst path/to/design.bin --extra-nvc-flag="--ieee-warnings=error"
FABulous> run_simulation fst path/to/design.bin --extra-ghdl-flag="--warn-error"

# Force a specific simulator backend
FABulous> run_simulation fst path/to/design.bin --simulator=nvc
FABulous> run_simulation fst path/to/design.bin --simulator=ghdl
FABulous> run_simulation fst path/to/design.bin --simulator=xvhdl

# Combine options
FABulous> run_simulation vcd path/to/design.bin -d my_design -if "-DDEBUG -DTRACE"
```

| Flag | Short | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--design` | `-d` | Override the design name (default: inferred from bitstream filename) |
| `--simulator` | `-s` | Simulator backend: `iverilog` or `xvlog` (Verilog), `nvc`, `ghdl`, `xvhdl`, or `auto` (VHDL). Unset leaves the choice to the Taskfile |
| `--extra-iverilog-flag` | `-if` | Extra flags for iverilog (Verilog projects) |
| `--extra-nvc-flag` | `-nf` | Extra flags for NVC (VHDL projects) |
| `--extra-ghdl-flag` | `-gf` | Extra flags for GHDL (VHDL projects) |

### Verilog vs. VHDL

Each project language gets its own `Taskfile.yml` tailored to the appropriate
toolchain.

- **Verilog projects** use [Icarus Verilog](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/)
  (`iverilog` / `vvp`) for simulation.
- **VHDL projects** use [NVC](https://github.com/nickg/nvc) by default for simulation, with automatic fallback to [GHDL](https://ghdl.github.io/ghdl/) if NVC is not available.
  Both simulators require files to be compiled in dependency order, so the VHDL Taskfile
  compiles packages (`models_pack`) first, then tile files, then fabric
  infrastructure, and finally the user design and testbench.
  You can force a specific simulator by setting `SIMULATOR=nvc` or `SIMULATOR=ghdl`.

AMD Vivado's xsim runs both languages, selected by `SIMULATOR=xvlog` in a
Verilog project and `SIMULATOR=xvhdl` in a VHDL one. Either needs that analyser,
`xelab` and `xsim` on `PATH` from a Vivado installation. xsim exits 0 after a
testbench failure, so the task fails the run by grepping the simulator log; see
the `Test/README.md` of each template for the rest.

The same value drives the repository-level smoke test, where it also picks the
project language, so `task smoke-test SIMULATOR=xvhdl` creates a VHDL demo
project and runs it under xsim.

:::{note}
The `Taskfile.yml` is a regular YAML file that you can freely edit to add
custom steps or adjust the flow for your project. See the
[Taskfile documentation](https://taskfile.dev/usage/) for the full reference.
:::

:::{deprecated} next release
The legacy `Makefile` in `Test/` is deprecated and will be removed in the
next release. Please migrate to `Taskfile.yml`. The FABulous CLI
(`run_simulation`) will prefer `Taskfile.yml` when present and fall back to
`make` with a deprecation warning.
